Installation
============

Under Linux
-----------

First you need to install the required libraries. They are PySide_, numpy_,
scipy_ and matplotlib_. They are fairly popular and should be available on
all major distributions. Under Debian/Ubuntu, simply do::

    sudo apt-get install python3-pyside python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-matplotlib

Download the latest release zip on Github_, unzip it and simple click on 
``altai``. Moments later, you should be greeted by the main window.

Under Windows/MacOSX
--------------------

I had no opportunity to test *Altai* under Windows or MacOSX, but the libraries
used are all cross-platform, so if you get these installed, running *Altai*
should be no problem. If you want to see *Altai* become easier to install and
use under your OS, :ref:`feel free to join <contribute>`.
